## 💡 Why I Built This

When working on larger projects with React and frameworks like Three.js or Next.js, I often realized how valuable it is to revisit the fundamentals — not just to refresh, but to stay sharp and confident in core patterns.

This app is a space where I can practice, reflect, and grow — and now, share with others.
